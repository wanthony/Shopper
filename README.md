# Anthony's Smart Shopping

Anthony has developed a basic price comparison application to better assist him in searching for the best 
television to purchase.  He has created a simple method of scraping the first page of search results 
from Walmart to be displayed in a simple table.

He would like to be able to do more with this application, so he has tasked you with further development.

## Features to be Added

* Anthony would like to be able to search for any given term, and have results displayed automatically (without
  having to reload the page).
* He would like to be able to search not only Walmart, but Kmart as well.  This should be done in a similar
  manner to Walmart (scraping data from their search page).
* He would like the ability to "merge" search results.  For example, if a Walmart search produces a specific
  TV with model # "1234", and K-Mart returns the same TV, the best price should be displayed along with the
  retailer that provides the price.
* He would like to be able to sort results returned from a search by any available column.
* He would like the ability to mark a television as an item of interest.  He should be able to easily view 
  and manage a list of favorite televisions.
